    <p>The intention behind the film was to romanticize the actions of the hands when playing fighting games. The video’s title “Cache These Hands” is a play on words using cache to reference reading and writing memory in computers along with the slang term for the act of fighting. This is meant to show the players are acting from and writing to their own muscle memory while trying to pull off complex movements in the games.
