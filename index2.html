			<p>
				I like doing digital media art because it’s very broad and growing there will always be something new to explore. I like being a jack of all trades and incorporating as many new skills into my work as possible. Art is more of a learning experience. It’s trying different things inspired by what’s around me. A barebones experiment can lay the groundwork for a network of other pieces that come together to make a greater whole. My work is very personal. I love being sentimental and self referential with my own work. I'm strongly in favor of free use and remix culture. I love making mashups, collage, and fanart. My goal as an artist is to make things to have fun. I try to make things that are light hearted because I enjoy making people laugh. I have a lot of interest in creating pieces with bright vibrant colors and a modern graphic style. My infatuation with digital media began in photoshop edits and branched into video, and games. I want to create something that can connect to and feel personal to a lot of people. I want to create work for, and build communities.
