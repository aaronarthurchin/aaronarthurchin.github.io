			<p>
				As an artist I have a lot of interest in creating pieces with bright vibrant color with a modern graphic style. I appreciate small details and imperfections. 
				My work is very personal. I love being sentimental and self referential with my work and usually include small nods to past projects. I try to be light hearted and I enjoy making people laugh. 
				My philosophy is that my work will never be as good as the next person's. Creativity isn't a competition of originality. It's a learning experience where you try to absorb as much as you can out of the people around you. A good artist is one who can steal without anyone noticing. I'm against large ambitious projects. I believe undertaking large scale projects causes projects to fail because of the level of commitment involved. I like to get things done at the bare minimum level and use that as the framework to build out from. Essentially small pieces come together to form a greater whole. I want to try new things and learn to work with as many mediums as possible.  
				I'm strongly in favor of free use and remix culture. I love making mashups, collage, and fan art using my favorite characters. 
				My goal as an artist is to make things to have fun. I want to eventually make something that people can deeply connect and relate to. 
				My main source of inspiration is Anime and Manga and I'm really into the retro future vaporwave aesthetic.
