				Ever since I was young I loved to draw. I spent every recess with a notebook and pencil drawing. I cluttered the margins of every page of my notes and homework to a point where my teachers complained every time I turned something in.  I’ve always connected with characters in cartoons and books. My main influences are in anime and manga. What mainly stuck out were the extreme expressions that felt relatable. I want to create memorable and relatable experiences for others. My goal as an artist is to make things to have fun. I try to make things that are light hearted because I enjoy making people laugh.

In highschool I was introduced to digital art. Even though I wasn’t enrolled in the class at the time the animation/game design teacher was very supportive and helped me learn how to use a tablet during lunch. Later when I took his classes I learned how to use photoshop which changed the direction of my art. We had an assignment titled Mission Impossible, where we were to create a scene out of a collage of images photoshopped together. Ever since then digital collage has been one of my favorite things to create. The experience made me someone who’s strongly in favor of free use and remix culture.
</p>
<p>
In addition to photoshop, I learned the softwares Maya, and Toon Boom. This was the start of my interest in combining different mediums. When I applied to SJSU I originally wanted to do animation/illustration, instead I ended up taking the path of DMA to pursue a field where I could use more photoshop. Now I like doing digital media art because it’s very broad and growing there will always be something new to explore. I like being a jack of all trades and incorporating as many new skills into my work as possible. I gained a new viewpoint of art as a learning experience. I want to trying different things and absorb inspiration from what’s around me. A barebones experiment can lay the groundwork for a network of other pieces that come together to make a greater whole.
</p>
<p>
During my freshman year at SJSU I created a community on facebook and I use it as a platform for my collage art. I regularly make pieces connected orin reference to that community. I find it very rewarding to create art dedicated to or inspired by niche communities. My goal s to create art that feels personal, the community allows me to because I’ve gotten to know so many of the members. In general make things to be sentimental and self referential. After my experiences learning twine in art 75 and html in art 74 I think I can combine many of the things I like doing with net art. In the future a goal of mine is to create interactive net art.
</p>
<p>
As far as career goals I’ve always wanted to sell art at conventions, exhibit, or work for a gaming company.
