					<h3>Toby</h3>
					A collection of three pictures that tell the story of a dog waking up and suddenly being alone. I arranged the images into panels with a manga influence. My goal was to take advantage of the way we anthropomorphize animals. I left all of the bubbles blank because we project thoughts and feelings onto animals, when we interpret their actions. Similar to Jim Davis’ Garfield, I used thought bubbles because we can't actually understand animals. All of Garfield's dialogue are actually the thoughts of John. I left the bubbles blank so the audience can apply their own thoughts.

							This is a digital painting of three of my original characters that I played as over three different Dungeons and Dragons campaigns. My goal was to add dimension and flow to my characters’ poses. I was influenced by the process of artist Hirohiko Araki who draws his characters with poses based on Greek/Roman sculpture.

							<h3>Daily Hell 2018 Banner</h3>
							This piece was meant to be a banner for a Facebook group I created during my first semester at SJSU. The group revolves around a type of post called a "daily", you choose a subject that makes you happy and post it every day, with a summary of how your day went. The group became a platform for my art. Every month I make collages based on 5 subjects the community votes for, and dedicate them to one member. This banner incorporates elements of glitch art. Using audacity I embedded audio of the chosen member singing into the image. A general theme of the banners is compositing member avatars on to images from real life. It’s meant to signify how the online friendships made in the group are just as valid as real ones.

						<h3>Cache These Hands</h3>
						The intention behind the film was to romanticize the actions of the hands when playing fighting games. The video’s title “Cache These Hands” is a play on words using cache to reference reading and writing memory in computers along with the slang term for the act of fighting. This is meant to show the players are acting from and writing to their own muscle memory while trying to pull off complex movements in the games.

				<h3>Internet browsing simulator</h3>
			my project is about the process of browsing the internet. This project recreates the interface of multiple popular websites and simulates web browsing when bombarded by ads. Theatrification comes into play when attempting to close ads. The ads plea for their lives, guilt you, or reveal their facade and threaten you. The act of closing them is dramatically killing them, with the sound of a knife and scream. The pages flow together as a nonlinear narative where your interactions will decide which page you see next. The narrative ends when an ad tricks you into downloading ad blocker software that's actually ransomware that locks you out of continuing. In terms of visual treatment this is a stylized skeuomorphism that parodies recognizable websites. <a href="js/final/sketch.js" target="_blank">see code (main) </a> <a href="js/final/scenes.js" target="_blank">see code (scenes) </a>

					<h3>Nat 20</h3>
					This piece was inspired by the artist Nick Briz and made using his online tools. It is based on a Dungeons and Dragons campaign where my party jumped into a bag of holding. It is supposed to represent what it’s like exploring and getting lost in an infinite space. Inhabiting the space are rotating wireframe icosahedrons that represent the 20 sided dice that are used to determine most of the outcomes when playing Dungeons and Dragons.

				<h3>Personalized Madcatz TE2+</h3>
				With this I wanted to recreate a complex object that I’m familiar with in Maya. It is a Madcatz TE2+ that is personalized for when I participate in game tournaments. I use the fight stick very often so I wanted to map it out with my hands. I wanted to make use of specular and bump maps to detail the texture of the different plastics and acrylics of the product.

						<h3>Virtual_Life_Form_Observation</h3>
						Virtual avatars are our delegates for online action. At their current stage they are hollow shells that await our control. As technology continues to progress towards automating every aspect of life, our avatars will soon take over our identity. With future Ai we will create simulations of ourselves. This is early footage of the incubation of my avatar. Seeded with playful action we can observe the Ai learning what it means to think independently.

				<h3>Ball Rehersal</h3>
				The scene depicts a 3D ball that attempts to learn from its 2D predecessor. This piece is a digital painting that seeks to deconstruct animation and consider what it means for a piece to move. The composition is inspired by the paintings of 3D still lifes created by Kristoff Zetterstrand. This piece is shot at 12 frames per second to refer to the frame rate of traditional hand drawn animation. Hand drawn is organic, it is imperfect, and at its soul is the hand of the animator. Computer generated animation seeks to mimic the organic, it is perfect, and artificial from its inception. Today cgi threatens to replace hand drawn animation in media. Lurching out from the darkness is a sinister icon of 3D animation.

			<h3>Eurythenes Plasticus Fossil</h3>
3D Printed Object, 3x5x2 in, pictured is a rendered image of the 3D mesh for print. This piece’s life began while researching articles related to additivism and posthumanism. It is inspired by Eurythenes Plasticus which was a new species of crustacean whose discovery was published the week this piece’s inception. The organism lives in the virgin landscape of the Mariana trench thought to be untouched by humanity. Unfortunately however this animal’s name is derived from the type of microplastic pollution found throughout its body. Plastic is a poison created by man that will remain on earth long after our departure. The bodies of future organisms will continue to contain plastic and it will be left behind in their fossilized corpses. The file to print this piece will be distributed online for free. I want as many prints of this to be made for future paleontologists to find. I want it to be used to date future fossils and rock layers to mark the Anthropocene.

			<h3>Can Of Moe</h3>
I turned a simple cylinder into a complex can. This was an exercize in planar mapping for texture,bump, and specular. The goal was to create and market a fictional brand/product inspired by 2000's era anime. It was also an exercize in lighting and rendering in Maya's classic redering engine.
