				<h3>Daily Hell 2018 Banner</h3>
				This piece was meant to be a banner for a Facebook group I created during my first semester at SJSU. The group revolves a type of post called a "daily" you choose a subject that makes you happy and post it every day with a summary of how your day went. The group became a platform for my art where I make collages based on 5 subjects the community votes for, and dedicate them to one member. This banner incorporates elements of glitch art. Using audacity I embedded audio of the chosen member singing into the image. A general theme of the banners is compositing member avatars on to images from real life. It’s meant to signify how the online friendships made in the group are just as valid as real ones.

					<h3>Lenception</h3>
					The intent was to play with the idea of seeing the artist in their work. The subject of the photograph is someone photographing me. In the reflection of their lens I can be seen taking the photograph that became the piece.

					<h3>Toby</h3>
					A collection of three pictures that tell the story of a dog waking up and suddenly being alone. I arranged the images into panels with a manga influence. My goal was to take advantage of the way we anthropomorphize animals. I left all of the bubbles blank because we project thoughts and feelings onto animals, when we interpret their actions. Similar to Jim Davis’ Garfield, I used thought bubbles because we can't actually understand animals. All of Garfield's dialogue are actually the thoughts of John. I left the bubbles blank so the audience can apply their own thoughts.

  						<h3>Home Video Died For This</h3>
  						A film exploring nostalgia and the concept of the future being a part of the past. A collection of Snapchat and other digital videos, which replaced the traditional home video are taken back to the vhs era. The video is to highlight the difference in how home videos are treated and viewed today.

						<h3>Cache These Hands</h3>
						The intention behind the film was to romanticize the actions of the hands when playing fighting games. The video’s title “Cache These Hands” is a play on words using cache to reference reading and writing memory in computers along with the slang term for the act of fighting. This is meant to show the players are acting from and writing to their own muscle memory while trying to pull off complex movements in the games.

					<h3>Nat 20</h3>
					This piece was inspired by the artist Nick Briz and made using his online tools. It is based on a Dungeons and Dragons campaign where my party jumped into a bag of holding. It is supposed to represent what it’s like exploring and getting lost in an infinite space. Inhabiting the space are rotating wireframe icosahedrons that represent the 20 sided dice that are used to determine most of the outcomes when playing Dungeons and Dragons.

					<h3>Flappy Run</h3>
					The goal of this piece was to create something simple and interactive in javascript. It is a stripped down version of the game Flappy Bird where the bird can no longer fly. The game has been converted into and infinite runner similar to the no internet connection dinosaur game on google chrome.

				<h3>Personalized Madcatz TE2+</h3>
				With this I wanted to recreate a complex object that I’m familiar with in Maya. It is a Madcatz TE2+ that is personalized for when I participate in game tournaments. I use the fight stick very often so I wanted to map it out with my hands. I wanted to make use of specular and bump maps to detail the texture of the different plastics and acrylics of the product.
